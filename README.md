# Hello!

This is an old cluster analysis of twitter data.  It's for kind of a non-statistical
audience just to show how even fairly simple tools can start to say interesting
things about corpuses.  

## Unfortunately....

The twitter API v1 no longer works, so running this code is no longer effective.
However, I do have updated repos that are using more current versions of the twitter API.
I'll link to those eventually....
